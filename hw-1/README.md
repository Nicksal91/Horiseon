Horiseon Webpage Clean Up

In this project I focused on cleaning up the html and css of the Horiseon website to make the coding more consolidated, organized, and accessible. 

First, within the HTML, I cleaned up a few things. There was an issue where the title simply said, "website", I fixed that by changing it to "Horiseon - Official Home Page" because I felt it made the website more professional.

Next, I added some alt text for most of the images on the webpage so if there is an issue where the are not loading, there will still be a brief description of the photo that is there.

For the CSS, I just consolidated a lot of the code, that had the same aspects, into one single code line. I did this to make it easier for someone to read through the CSS code so they would not have to search through a ton of repetitive coding.
